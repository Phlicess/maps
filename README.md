## Maps
 
Currently a research project to exploring a generic architecture for maps to support enhanced functionalities.

Including topics:

 - Higher frequency updates
 - Density counts, plus counts of distinct values (e.g. species counts)
 - Hexagon binning views
 - Equal area binning views (e.g. Google S2)
 - Mapping ad hoc SOLR search results for small, medium and large result sets
 - Fast disaster recovery and batch processing
 - Vector tile format (MVT) and UTF8 grid formats
 - Time series to year resolution 
 - Binning of data to month resolution (i.e. multiple years, but "January") 
 
The general architecture under research is depicted:
